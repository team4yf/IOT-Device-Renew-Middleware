Project Code: [DRM].

Itâ€™s a middleware for iot devices to renew their online status.

2 important logic: renew, timeup

Renew
1. Device renews itself 10s.
IOT -> DRM -> renew 10s 
2. DRM publishes an event notification right now if the device does not exist.
	DRM -> notify -> App

Timeup
1. DRM will publish an event notification in 10s if the device does not renew again.
DRM -> notify -> App
2. Check device
	App -> DRM -> check -> T/F


We supply 2 gRPC API
  - `/renew()`
  - `/check()`
There are 2 event notifications
  - `$drm/online/:device`
  - `$drm/offline/:device`
